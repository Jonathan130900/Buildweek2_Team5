# Spotify App BW2 - TEAM 5
This project is a clone of the music streaming platform Spotify and simulating some of it's functionalities.
***
## Home Page
### Desktop Screen Size
The Home Page will show us a list of Albums from various artists, where once clicked upon will bring you to that specific album. It will show 2 sidebars on each side, one containing the navigational links and playlists, while the other shows friends activity (not functioning, only for showcase purposes). It will also show the player at the bottom of the page with the current song selected. 
### Mobile Screen Size
The Home Page will show a grid showcasing 6 random albums, simulating how they would appear in the mobile app. Scrolling down it will then show a random selection of playlists which are for display only and not actual working playlists. The player is adapted for mobile viewing, showcasing the name of the artist and song animated like in the actual app. The sidebars will dissapear and the main navigational icons will be displayed beneath the player, at the bottom of the screen.
## Search Page
### Desktop Screen Size
The Search Page will display a visual-only rendition of the usual genre type of music you would find on the actual Spotify app. The searchbar functions in a way that if you search for an artist it will show the specific artist's albums and if you search for a song it will show tracks that share it's name and similar other tracks related.
### Mobile Screen Size
In the mobile screen format, not much will change but the cards will be in 2 columns instead of 4. Even the search results will not have any difference. This is the page that has the less amount of difference between screen sizes.
## 
## Artist Page
### Desktop Screen Size
The Artist Page will display the profile picture of the selected musician showing their name and monthly listeners. Beneath will be the following button, not interactive but simply recreated visually, and the play button, not interactive aswell. It will show a list of single tracks that are their most popular releases that come from different albums, all playable up to a max of 50 displayed music tracks.
### Mobile Screen Size
The difference isn't that much compared to the desktop viewing but simply the tracks will be a little more compressed and will lack the number of total listeners, while the play button will be displayed on the left side of the screen, compared to stayon the left with the rest of the buttons.
## Album Page
### Desktop Screen Size
The Album Page will display the cover of the album and on the right the album name with the name of the artist below the title. Non-interactive buttons are present below that section. A grid shows the title of the tracks, the number of plays and the duration, an ordered list showcases the tracks in their right order of the specific album selected, all playable.
### Mobile Screen Size
The album cover shows first with the title and artist name right below it. The button bar has non-interactive icons with the play button and random button displayed on the right. The songs displayed are like the desktop version, without the number of plays and duration.
## Sidebar
### Desktop Screen Size
The sidebar has 2 sections: the one on the left has the navigational functionality with the only 2 interactive buttons being Home and Search, including a personal playlist that is not interactive. The right side is a non-interactive friend activity sidebar, recreating how the app does. The sidebar remains the same on all pages.
### Mobile Screen Size
The sidebar dissapears from both sides and the navbar moves to the bottom of the screen with the icons Home, Search and Your Library which is the only button that is not interactive.
## Player
### Desktop Screen Size
The player takes the position on the bottom of the screen, with a working progress bar, a volume option, a play and pause button and a next and previous button. It will display the album cover and track name selected.
### Mobile Screen Size
The player appears above the navbar icons, displaying the album and the track name has an animation, passing by periodically like in the actual app. this time the only functioning buttons are the play and pause buttons and volume option.
