## Home Page
### Desktop Screen Size
The Home Page will show us a list of Albums from various artists, where once clicked upon will bring you to that specific album. It will show 2 sidebars on each side, one containing the navigational links and playlists, while the other shows friends activity (not functioning, only for showcase purposes). It will also show the player at the bottom of the page with the current song selected. 
### Mobile Screen Size
The Home Page will show a grid showcasing 6 random albums, simulating how they would appear in the mobile app. Scrolling down it will then show a random selection of playlists which are for display only and not actual working playlists. The player is adapted for mobile viewing, showcasing the name of the artist and song animated like in the actual app. The sidebars will dissapear and the main navigational icons will be displayed beneath the player, at the bottom of the screen.
